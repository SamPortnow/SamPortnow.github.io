      <description>Thoughts Warning: Massive Spoilers to Follow
You Were Never Really Here is the best meditation on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder that I have seen at the movies. Unlike most movies that deal with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is never mentioned. It’s not even alluded to. You Were Never Really Here doesn’t have a lot to say about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but that’s because the movie makes the viewer feel the symtpoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</description>
