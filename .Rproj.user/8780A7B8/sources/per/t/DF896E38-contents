# About me

I am currently a Statistician at the US Government Accountability Office. Before this, I received my Ph.D. in 2017 from the Community Psychology program at the University of Virginia. My research at UVa examined the impact of poverty on parenting behaviors and child achievement, and schools and classroom as interventions for economically disadvantaged children.

If you look around, you will find some blog posts, publications, and relevant code. You can also see a copy of my resume [here](/post/img/DataScienceResume.pdf).
